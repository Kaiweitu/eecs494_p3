1.
Problem: 
The relation between color of gear and gear function is not intuitive. Not friendly for color blind people.
Change:
Change the gear sprites to be related to corresponding functionality (weapon for attack, shield for defense, etc.).

2.
Problem:
Players are not clear when to refill bullets and cannot clearly tell if they can use the shield or not.
Change:
Add warning sign when bullets went out/shield is in cool down stage.

3.
Problem: Players cannot tell if they are locked/unlocked to the station. They cannot clearly tell whether they are in operation mode or not.
Change:
Add animation (light up sprite and lift up player) to give a clearer view of "locked" and "unlocked" state. These changes make the game more intuitive and clearer for our players.

4.
Problem:
Game not fun enough. The only way to win is to shoot at each other until someone wins. Movement is not useful comparing to shielding and attacking.
Change:
a) Add damage for collision between two submarines and between submarine and school. (other ways to attack)
b) Add random bombs in the environment. (urge players to move)

5.
Problem:
Sprites are too small so players cannot see them clear on a small screen.
Changes:
Enlarge gears and players to make it clearer and more playable on a small screen.

6.
Problem:
Shield breaks to fast and has a long cool down time, making the game deseperating sometimes.
Change:
Increased max health of shield,prolonged apperance time and reduced cool down time.

7.
Problem:
The movement of Submarine does not feel real: no momentum.
Change:
Re-design the input-control system. Use addForce() instead of changing submarine's velocity directly.

8.
Problem:
Player movement is not fluent and too slow.
Changes:
a) Add "dash" function for player movement.
b) Add "jump down" function when player is on the ladder.
c) Re-design the input-control system. Use addForce() instead of changing player's velocity directly.

9.
Problem:
Key usage not intuitive.
Changes:
Reassign key usage, so that lock/unlock to station using one key, with all other operation using another key.

10. Other iterations: 
a) Allow refilling before all bullets went out; 
b) Tutorial is updated accordingly;
c) Add extra sound effects.
