The biggest problem is balance. To solve the problem, we make the game 2vs2 and make both submarines identical. This change also helps us avoid having single player to have too much things to do.
To make all three operations (attack, defense, move) interesting, we add a bullet refill mechanism for the weapon, make the shield portable and enable bouncing back the bullets, and add schools in the environment to push the submarines to make players want to move their submarine.
To solve the feedback that the game cannot be played with Xbox, we changed from InControl to InputSystem. However, due to limited resources, we were only able to rent 1 Xbox but the IA said some problems only occurred when all four devices were plugged in. We tried our best to make sure Xbox is working.
Other iterations: adjust control keys to make the control more intuitive; add tutorial for guidance; add music and sound effects; add flashing before the controllers change position to help players notice the change; add explosion effect of bullets for juciness; add shake effect when the two submarines collide for juciness; add health bars to the controller to show the state of weapon and shield for clearness
