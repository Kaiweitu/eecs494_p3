Change the gear sprites to be related to corresponding functionality (weapon for attack, shield for defense, etc.), add warning sign when bullets went out/shield about to disappear. Add animation (light up sprite and lift up player) to give a clearer view of "locked" and "unlocked" state. These changes make the game more intuitive and clear for our players.
Add damage for collision between two submarines and between submarine and school. Add random bombs in the environment. This gives player other ways to attack each other, and urge them to move the submarine instead of just attacking and shielding.
Enlarge gears and players to make it more clear and playable on a small screen.
Other iterations: Allow refilling before all bullets went out; Add player dashing and jumping; Add momentum to make the submarine movement more realistic; Allow the fishes to be killed.
