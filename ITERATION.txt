1.
Problem: 
The relation between color of gear and gear function is not intuitive. Not friendly for color blind people.

Change:
Change the gear sprites to be related to corresponding functionality (weapon for attack, shield for defense, etc.).

2.
Problem:
Players are not clear when to refill bullets and cannot clearly tell if they can use the shield or not.

Change:
Add warning sign when bullets went out/shield is in cool down stage.

3.
Problem: Players cannot tell if they are locked/unlocked to the station. They cannot clearly tell whether they are in operation mode or not.

Change:
Add animation (light up sprite and lift up player) to give a clearer view of "locked" and "unlocked" state. These changes make the game more intuitive and clearer for our players.

4.
Problem:
Game not fun enough. Players just shoot at each other until someone wins.

Change:
a) Add damage for collision between two submarines and between submarine and school. (other ways to attack)
b) Add random bombs in the environment. (urge them to move)

5.
Problem:
Sprites are too small.

Changes:
Enlarge gears and players to make it clearer and more playable on a small screen.

6.
Problem:
Shield breaks to fast and has a long cool down time, making the game deseperating sometimes.

Change:
Increased max health of shield,prolonged apperance time and reduced cool down time.

7.
Problem:
The movement of Submarine does not feel like submarine: no momentum.

Change:
Re-disign the input-control system. Use addForce() instead of changing submarine's velocity directly.

8.
Problem:
Player/Character movement is not fluent. 

Changes:
a) Add "dash" function for player movement.
b) Add "jump down" function when player is on the ladder.
c) Re-disign the input-control system. Use addForce() instead of changing player's velocity directly.

7. Other iterations: 
a) Allow refilling before all bullets went out; 
b) Tutorial is updated accordingly;
c) Add some sound effect.
