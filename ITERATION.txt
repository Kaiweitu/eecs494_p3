1.Problem: The relation between color of gear and gear function is not intuitive. Not friendly for color blind people.
Change:  Change the gear sprites to be related to corresponding functionality (weapon for attack, shield for defense, etc.).
2. Problem: Players are not clear when to refill bullets and cannot clearly tell if they can use the shield or not.
Change: Add warning sign when bullets went out/shield is in cool down stage. 
3. Problem: Players cannot tell if they are locked/unlocked. They cannot clearly tell whether they are in operation mode or not.
Change: Add animation (light up sprite and lift up player) to give a clearer view of "locked" and "unlocked" state. These changes make the game more intuitive and clearer for our players.
4. Problem: Game not fun enough. Players just shoot at each other until someone wins.
Change: Add damage for collision between two submarines and between submarine and school. Add random bombs in the environment. These give players other ways to attack each other and urge them to move the submarine instead of just attacking and shielding.
5. Problem: Sprites are too small.
Enlarge gears and players to make it clearer and more playable on a small screen.
6. Problem: Shield breaks to fast and has a long cool down time, making the game deseperating sometimes.
Change: Increased max health of shield,prolonged apperance time and reduced cool down time.
7. Other iterations: 
Allow refilling before all bullets went out; Add player dashing and jumping; Add momentum to make the submarine movement more realistic; Allow the fishes to be killed; Change implementation of submarine movement to integrate with unity physics system.
