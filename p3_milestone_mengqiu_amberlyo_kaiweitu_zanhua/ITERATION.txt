1. 
Issue (from feedback):
Balance between 2 teams. One team could win easily over the other in our previous version. There is too much work to do for the single player in the small submarine.

Current Solution and Change:
We make the game 2vs2 and make both submarines identical. This change also helps avoid a single player having too much things to do.

2.
Issue (from feedback):
Balance between operations (attack, defense, move). In previous version, players tend to just attack without defending at all. Players are more motivated to attack instead of defending of moving.

Current Solution and Change:
First (attack), we add a bullet refill mechanism for the weapon. In this way, players will run out of bullets if they do not leave the attacking gear to refill the weapon. Second (defense), we make the shield portable and enable bouncing back the bullets. Now the shield is more powerful so players are more motivated to use it. Third (move), we add schools in the environment that can push a submarine away from its original place. Players will want to move their submarine back to a proper placeã€€for better attack.

3.
Issue (from feedback):
Game cannot be played with Xbox in multiplayer mode(with 3 or 4 Xboxes).

Current Solution and Change:
We changed from InControl to InputSystem. However, due to limited resources, we were only able to rent 1 Xbox controller and test using 3 PS4 controllers with this XBox Controllers. We tried our best to make sure Xbox is working.

4.
Issue (from feedback):
Key assignment is not intuitive. For example, when attacking, both controlling the direction of weapon and triggering attack are using right hands.

Current Solution and Change:
We reassigned keys so that all actions/operations can be done intuitively. We changed weapon and shield position adjustment from using right stick to left stick so only one stick is used and players do not have to constantly switch between two sticks plus the action buttons for control.

5.
Issue (from feedback):
Music and sound effect are necessary parts but missing.

Current Solution and Change:
We add music and sound effects.

6.
Issue (from feedback):
Players can not move freely/easily around ladder.

Current Solution and Change:
We re-dsign the input and movement controlling method. We also re-design the collider of ladder.

7.
Issue (from feedback):
Positions of gears/controllers change is hard to notice and is sudden.

Current Solution and Change:
We add flashing effect when gears/controllers are about to change position. This is to notify the change to the players.

Other iterations:
a. add tutorial for guidance.
b. add explosion effect of bullets for juciness. (juciness)
c. add shake effect when the two submarines collide. (juciness)
d. add health bars to the gears to show the state of weapon and shield. (clearness)
